# Background tasks

FastAPI provides built-in support for background tasks, which is very useful for offloading work that can be done asynchronously, such as sending emails, processing data, or interacting with external services without holding up the main request/response cycle. This helps in keeping the API responsive and performant.

### Background Tasks with FastAPI

#### Basic Usage

1. **Import BackgroundTasks**

   FastAPI provides the `BackgroundTasks` class for defining tasks that should run in the background.

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
   ```

2. **Define a Background Task Function**

   The background task function can be any callable (function or class with a `__call__` method). This function will execute asynchronously after the response is sent.

   ```python
   def write_log(message: str):
       with open("log.txt", "a") as log_file:
           log_file.write(f"{message}\n")
   ```

   In this example, `write_log` is a function that appends a message to a log file. This is a simple task that you want to run in the background.

3. **Add Background Tasks to Endpoints**

   You can add background tasks to your endpoint by including `BackgroundTasks` in the parameters of the endpoint function.

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post("/items/")
   async def create_item(name: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
       background_tasks.add_task(write_log, f"Item {name} was created.")
       return {"message": f"Item {name} created successfully!"}
   ```

   - The `background_tasks.add_task()` method schedules the `write_log` function to run in the background after the response is sent.
   - You can pass any number of arguments to `add_task()`, which will be used to call the task function.

#### Example: Sending Emails

Sending emails is a common background task in web applications. Let’s see how to set up such a task with FastAPI.

1. **Define the Background Task**

   Assume you have a function to send an email. This function could be more complex and involve interacting with an email service or SMTP server.

   ```python
   def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
       # Simulate sending an email (e.g., connect to an SMTP server and send the email)
       with open("emails.log", "a") as email_log:
           email_log.write(f"To: {to}\nSubject: {subject}\n\n{body}\n\n")
   ```

   - This function logs the email to a file instead of sending it for simplicity.

2. **Add the Task to an Endpoint**

   You can schedule the email to be sent in the background after the response is returned to the client.

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post("/send-email/")
   async def send_email_endpoint(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
       background_tasks.add_task(send_email, email, "Welcome!", "Thank you for signing up!")
       return {"message": "Email will be sent soon"}
   ```

   - This endpoint accepts an email address and schedules the `send_email` function to run in the background.

3. **Running the Application**

   Start the application with Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   When you send a POST request to `/send-email/`, FastAPI will immediately return the response while the email is being "sent" in the background.

#### Example Project

Here’s a complete example demonstrating background tasks:

1. **Project Structure**

   ```
   fastapi_project/
   │
   ├── main.py
   ├── log.txt
   └── emails.log
   ```

   - `log.txt` will store log messages.
   - `emails.log` will store email logs.

2. **main.py**

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks

   app = FastAPI()

   def write_log(message: str):
       with open("log.txt", "a") as log_file:
           log_file.write(f"{message}\n")

   def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
       with open("emails.log", "a") as email_log:
           email_log.write(f"To: {to}\nSubject: {subject}\n\n{body}\n\n")

   @app.post("/items/")
   async def create_item(name: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
       background_tasks.add_task(write_log, f"Item {name} was created.")
       return {"message": f"Item {name} created successfully!"}

   @app.post("/send-email/")
   async def send_email_endpoint(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
       background_tasks.add_task(send_email, email, "Welcome!", "Thank you for signing up!")
       return {"message": "Email will be sent soon"}
   ```

   - The `/items/` endpoint logs a message about the item creation.
   - The `/send-email/` endpoint schedules sending an email.

3. **Testing the Application**

   - Start the FastAPI server.
   - Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send POST requests to the endpoints.
   - Check `log.txt` and `emails.log` to see the results of the background tasks.

### Advanced Background Tasks

For more complex scenarios, you might need more advanced solutions. Here are a few options:

1. **Using Celery for Distributed Tasks**

   If you need to manage complex background jobs, such as distributed task queues, Celery is a popular choice. It works well with FastAPI for handling tasks that might take a long time or need to be processed in parallel.

   ```python
   # tasks.py
   from celery import Celery

   celery_app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

   @celery_app.task
   def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
       # Code to send email
       pass
   ```

   In FastAPI, you would call this task:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from tasks import send_email

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post("/send-email/")
   async def send_email_endpoint(email: str):
       send_email.delay(email, "Welcome!", "Thank you for signing up!")
       return {"message": "Email will be sent soon"}
   ```

   - Celery uses a message broker (like Redis) to manage task distribution and scheduling.

2. **Using BackgroundTask for Inline Tasks**

   For lightweight background tasks, FastAPI’s `BackgroundTasks` is often sufficient. However, for more elaborate control or if tasks need to interact with your main application logic, you might consider a different architecture, like integrating a task queue or using threading/asyncio for parallelism.

### Conclusion

FastAPI’s background tasks provide a simple and efficient way to handle asynchronous processing. Whether you’re logging information, sending emails, or performing other background operations, FastAPI makes it easy to keep your main API responsive while managing additional workloads behind the scenes. For more complex requirements, integrating with task queues like Celery can offer more advanced capabilities.
