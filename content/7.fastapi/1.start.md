# Getting started

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints. It's known for its speed and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers looking to build scalable and robust APIs.

### Getting Started with FastAPI

1. **Setup Your Environment** Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed.
2. **Create Your First FastAPI Application**\* Create a new Python file, `main.py`, and start by writing a simple FastAPI app:
   ````python
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"Hello": "World"}
   ```* This code creates a basic FastAPI app with a single route, `/`, which returns a JSON response.
   ````
3. **Run Your Application**\* You can run your FastAPI application using `uvicorn`, an ASGI server:
   ````bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```* Here, `main` is the name of the Python file (without the `.py` extension) and `app` is the FastAPI instance. The `--reload` flag is used for auto-reloading during development.
   ````
4. **Access the Interactive API Documentation**\* Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see the automatically generated Swagger UI for your API.
   * You can also access the alternative ReDoc documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`.
5. **Expanding Your Application**\* You can define more routes with various HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.:
   ```python
   @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
   def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
       return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

   @app.post("/items/")
   def create_item(item: dict):
       return {"item_name": item['name'], "item_price": item['price']}
   ```
6. **Using Pydantic for Data Validation**\* FastAPI leverages Pydantic models for data validation and parsing:
   ````python
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class Item(BaseModel):
       name: str
       description: str = None
       price: float
       tax: float = None

   @app.post("/items/")
   def create_item(item: Item):
       return {"item": item}
   ```* Here, `Item` is a Pydantic model that enforces the structure and types of data.
   ````
7. **Handling Dependencies**\* FastAPI supports dependency injection. You can define dependencies that can be shared across different endpoints:
   ```python
   from fastapi import Depends

   def common_parameters(q: str = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
       return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}

   @app.get("/items/")
   def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
       return commons
   ```

### Additional Resources

- **Official Documentation**: The [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is comprehensive and provides detailed guides and examples.
- **Tutorials**: There are many tutorials available online that cover various aspects of FastAPI, from basic usage to advanced features like background tasks and WebSockets.
- **Community**: Join the [FastAPI community](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/community/) to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn from others.

### Example Project Structure

For a more organized and scalable project, you might want to structure your FastAPI application as follows:

```text
project/
│
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py
│   ├── schemas.py
│   └── dependencies.py
│
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_main.py
│
└── requirements.txt
```

This structure helps in maintaining clean and modular code, especially as your project grows.

With these basics, you should be well-equipped to start building applications with FastAPI.
