# TREES

A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure that represents a hierarchical relationship between elements. Trees are widely used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a hierarchical manner, making them efficient for search, insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

### Basic Terminology:

1. **Node**: Each element in a tree is called a node.
2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree.
3. **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
4. **Child**: Nodes directly connected to a parent node.
5. **Leaf**: Nodes with no children.
6. **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child.
7. **Subtree**: A tree rooted at a node, comprising all its descendants.
8. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node.
9. **Height**: The height of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

### Types of Trees:

1. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
4. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
5. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
6. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaves are at the same level.

### Operations on Trees:

1. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes of a tree in a specific order.
2. **Search**: Finding a specific node in the tree.
3. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree.
4. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree.
5. **Modification**: Updating the value of a node in the tree.
6. **Height Calculation**: Determining the height of the tree or a specific node.

### Applications of Trees:

1. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
2. **Expression Trees**: Used for representing and evaluating arithmetic expressions.
3. **Binary Heap**: Used in priority queues and heap sort algorithms.
4. **Tree Traversal Algorithms**: Used in parsing, compiling, and evaluating tree-based data structures.
5. **File System Hierarchies**: Used for organizing files and directories in file systems.

Trees are fundamental data structures with various applications in computer science, software engineering, and information technology. They provide an efficient and flexible way to organize and represent hierarchical relationships between data elements.
