# Memory Representation
Memory representation and basic operations for some common data structures are as follows:

### 1. Arrays:

- **Memory Representation**: Contiguous block of memory where elements are stored sequentially.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Accessing elements by index: `array[index]`
    - Insertion at the end: `array.append(value)`
    - Deletion by index: `del array[index]`
    - Finding length: `len(array)`

### 2. Linked Lists:

- **Memory Representation**: Nodes containing data and a pointer/reference to the next node.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Insertion at the beginning:
        
        ```python
        new_node = Node(value)
        new_node.next = head
        head = new_node
        
        ```
        
    - Deletion at the beginning:
        
        ```python
        temp = head
        head = head.next
        temp.next = None
        
        ```
        
    - Traversal:
        
        ```python
        current = head
        while current is not None:
            print(current.data)
            current = current.next
        
        ```
        

### 3. Stacks:

- **Memory Representation**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Push (Insertion): `stack.push(value)`
    - Pop (Deletion): `stack.pop()`
    - Peek (Access top element): `stack.peek()`
    - Checking if empty: `stack.is_empty()`

### 4. Queues:

- **Memory Representation**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Enqueue (Insertion): `queue.enqueue(value)`
    - Dequeue (Deletion): `queue.dequeue()`
    - Peek (Access front element): `queue.peek()`
    - Checking if empty: `queue.is_empty()`

### 5. Trees:

- **Memory Representation**: Nodes containing data and references/pointers to child nodes.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Insertion:
        - Binary Search Tree: Recursively traverse and insert based on comparison with node values.
    - Deletion:
        - Binary Search Tree: Replace with successor or predecessor node.
    - Traversal:
        - In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversal algorithms.

### 6. Graphs:

- **Memory Representation**: Adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
- **Basic Operations**:
    - Insertion of vertices and edges.
    - Deletion of vertices and edges.
    - Traversal: Depth-first search (DFS), Breadth-first search (BFS).

These are basic representations and operations for each data structure. The actual implementation details may vary based on language and specific requirements.
