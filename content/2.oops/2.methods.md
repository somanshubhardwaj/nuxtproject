# METHODS

In Python, methods are functions that are defined within a class and are associated with objects (instances) of that class. They define the behavior or actions that objects can perform. Here's an overview of methods in Python:

### Instance Methods:

Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They are defined with the `def` keyword and take `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance calling the method.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"

# Creating an object
obj = MyClass("Alice")

# Calling an instance method
print(obj.greet())  # Output: Hello, Alice!

```

### Class Methods:

Class methods are defined with the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` as the first parameter, which refers to the class itself. They can be called on either the class or its instances.

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def say_hello(cls):
        return "Hello from MyClass!"

# Calling a class method
print(MyClass.say_hello())  # Output: Hello from MyClass!

```

### Static Methods:

Static methods are defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take `self` or `cls` as parameters. They are independent of the class and can be called on either the class or its instances.

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

# Calling a static method
print(MyClass.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5

```

### Special Methods (Magic Methods):

Special methods, also known as magic methods, are predefined method names in Python enclosed in double underscores. They enable operator overloading and provide functionality for built-in operations.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.x + other

# Using a special method for addition
obj = MyClass(5)
result = obj + 3
print(result)  # Output: 8

```

### Method Chaining:

Method chaining involves calling multiple methods on an object consecutively in a single line. It enhances readability and conciseness of code.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        return self

    def double(self):
        self.value *= 2
        return self

# Method chaining
obj = MyClass()
result = obj.increment().double().increment()
print(result.value)  # Output: 3

```

Methods are essential for defining the behavior of objects in Python. They enable encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, key principles of object-oriented programming.
