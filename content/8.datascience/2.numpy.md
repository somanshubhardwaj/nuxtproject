# NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Here are some key features and capabilities of NumPy:

1. **Arrays**: NumPy's main object is the `ndarray`, a multidimensional array that provides a fast and efficient way of storing and manipulating data.

2. **Mathematical Functions**: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that operate on arrays, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponents, etc.

3. **Broadcasting**: NumPy operations on arrays of different shapes can be performed implicitly via broadcasting, which makes it possible to write concise and readable code without unnecessary duplication of data.

4. **Indexing and Slicing**: NumPy arrays support advanced indexing techniques that allow for efficient access to elements or subsets of the array's data.

5. **Linear Algebra Operations**: NumPy has a rich set of functions for linear algebra operations, including matrix multiplication, matrix decompositions, solving linear equations, etc.

6. **Random Number Generation**: NumPy provides functions to generate random numbers and random samples from various probability distributions.

7. **Performance**: NumPy's core operations are implemented in C, which makes them extremely fast compared to pure Python implementations. It is a foundational package for many other scientific computing libraries in Python.

8. **Integration with Other Libraries**: NumPy integrates well with other libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, such as SciPy (for scientific and technical computing), Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization), and Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis).

In summary, NumPy is essential for tasks involving numerical data in Python, providing efficient data structures, mathematical functions, and tools for working with arrays. It is widely used in fields such as physics, engineering, finance, machine learning, and more where fast array processing capabilities are crucial.

## NumPy tutorial

Certainly! Here’s a basic tutorial to get you started with NumPy in Python:

### Installation

First, ensure you have NumPy installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Importing NumPy

Once installed, you can import NumPy in your Python script or interactive session:

```python
import numpy as np
```

### NumPy Arrays

#### Creating NumPy Arrays

You can create NumPy arrays in several ways:

1. **From a Python list:**

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

2. **Using built-in functions:**

```python
# Create a 1D array of zeros
zeros_arr = np.zeros(5)
print(zeros_arr)

# Create a 2D array of ones
ones_arr = np.ones((3, 4))  # 3 rows, 4 columns
print(ones_arr)

# Create an array of evenly spaced values
range_arr = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # start, stop (exclusive), step
print(range_arr)

# Create a 2D array of random values
rand_arr = np.random.rand(2, 3)  # 2 rows, 3 columns
print(rand_arr)
```

#### Array Attributes

NumPy arrays have useful attributes:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr.shape)  # Shape of the array (rows, columns)
print(arr.ndim)   # Number of dimensions (2 for a 2D array)
print(arr.size)   # Total number of elements
print(arr.dtype)  # Data type of the elements (e.g., int64)
```

#### Array Indexing and Slicing

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr[0, 1])      # Access element at row 0, column 1
print(arr[:, 1])      # Access all rows, column 1
print(arr[1, :2])     # Access row 1, columns 0 and 1

# Boolean indexing
bool_arr = arr > 3    # Create a boolean array based on condition
print(arr[bool_arr])  # Elements where bool_arr is True
```

#### Array Operations

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)    # Element-wise addition
print(a * b)    # Element-wise multiplication
print(np.dot(a, b))  # Dot product of two arrays
print(np.sum(a))     # Sum of all elements in the array
print(np.mean(b))    # Mean of all elements in the array
```

#### Reshaping Arrays

```python
arr = np.arange(1, 10)
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(3, 3)  # Reshape to a 3x3 array
print(reshaped_arr)
```

### Further Learning

This tutorial covers the basics of NumPy. For more advanced topics like broadcasting, linear algebra operations, and integrating NumPy with other libraries like Matplotlib or Pandas, you can refer to the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).

NumPy is foundational for data manipulation and analysis in Python, and mastering it will greatly enhance your ability to work with numerical data effectively.

## NumPy fundamentals

Certainly! Here are some fundamental concepts in NumPy:

### 1. **NumPy Arrays**

NumPy arrays, or `ndarrays`, are the core data structure for NumPy. They are similar to Python lists but offer more efficient storage and operations for numerical data. Key points include:

- **Creating Arrays**: You can create arrays using `np.array()` from Python lists or using built-in functions like `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, and `np.random.rand()`.

- **Array Attributes**: Arrays have attributes like `shape` (dimensions), `ndim` (number of dimensions), `size` (total number of elements), and `dtype` (data type of elements).

- **Indexing and Slicing**: Similar to Python lists, arrays support indexing and slicing. For multi-dimensional arrays, you can use comma-separated indices or slices.

- **Boolean Indexing**: You can create boolean arrays and use them for indexing to filter elements based on conditions.

### 2. **Array Operations**

NumPy provides efficient operations on arrays:

- **Element-wise Operations**: NumPy allows you to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division element-wise between arrays.

- **Universal Functions (ufuncs)**: These are functions that operate element-wise on arrays. Examples include `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.exp()`, etc.

- **Aggregation Functions**: NumPy provides functions like `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.min()`, `np.max()` to compute aggregations over the entire array or along specific axes.

- **Broadcasting**: NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows operations between arrays of different shapes, under certain conditions, to be performed implicitly.

### 3. **Array Manipulation**

NumPy offers several functions for manipulating arrays:

- **Reshaping**: You can reshape arrays using `reshape()` to change their dimensions, as long as the total number of elements remains the same.

- **Concatenation and Splitting**: NumPy allows you to concatenate arrays using `np.concatenate()`, `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`, and split arrays using `np.split()`.

- **Transposition**: Arrays can be transposed using `arr.T` to switch rows and columns.

### 4. **Linear Algebra with NumPy**

NumPy provides comprehensive support for linear algebra operations:

- **Matrix Operations**: You can perform matrix multiplication using `np.dot()` or `@` operator, compute matrix determinant (`np.linalg.det()`), inverse (`np.linalg.inv()`), and solve linear systems (`np.linalg.solve()`).

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: NumPy offers functions like `np.linalg.eig()` to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

### 5. **Random Number Generation**

NumPy includes tools for random number generation:

- **Random Sampling**: You can generate random samples from various probability distributions using functions like `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.randn()`, `np.random.randint()`, etc.

### 6. **Performance**

NumPy operations are typically faster than equivalent Python operations on lists due to NumPy's implementation in C and its efficient handling of memory.

### Example:

Here’s a brief example demonstrating some of these concepts:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Array attributes
print(a.shape)  # (5,)
print(b.shape)  # (2, 3)
print(b.ndim)   # 2
print(b.size)   # 6
print(b.dtype)  # int64

# Indexing and slicing
print(a[0])       # 1
print(b[1, 2])    # 6
print(b[:, 1])    # [2 5]
print(b[1, :2])   # [4 5]

# Array operations
print(a + 2)      # [3 4 5 6 7]
print(np.sin(a))  # [ 0.84147098  0.90929743  0.14112001 -0.7568025  -0.95892427]
print(np.sum(b))  # 21

# Linear algebra
c = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(np.linalg.det(c))   # -2.0
print(np.linalg.inv(c))   # [[-2.   1. ]
                          #  [ 1.5 -0.5]]

# Random number generation
print(np.random.rand(3, 2))  # Generate a 3x2 array of random numbers
```
