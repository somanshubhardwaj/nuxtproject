# Working with database

Working with databases in Django involves defining models, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and managing migrations. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to work with databases in Django:

### Defining Models

1. **Create Models**: Define your data models in Django by creating Python classes that inherit from `django.db.models.Model`.

   ```python
   # models.py
   from django.db import models

   class Author(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       biography = models.TextField()

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name

   class Book(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       published_date = models.DateField()

       def __str__(self):
           return self.title
   ```

   - **Field Types**: Use Django's model fields (`CharField`, `IntegerField`, `ForeignKey`, etc.) to define the structure of your data.
   - **Relationships**: Establish relationships between models using `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField`, or `ManyToManyField`.

### Creating and Applying Migrations

1. **Generate Migrations**: After defining models, create migration files that define database schema changes.

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

   This command analyzes changes to your models and creates migration files in the `migrations` directory of each app.

2. **Apply Migrations**: Apply migrations to synchronize the database schema with the current state of your models.

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   Django executes these migrations to create or update database tables accordingly.

### Performing CRUD Operations

1. **Creating Objects**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Author, Book

   # Create a new author
   author = Author.objects.create(name='John Doe', biography='Lorem ipsum...')

   # Create a new book associated with the author
   book = Book.objects.create(title='Sample Book', author=author, published_date='2023-01-01')
   ```

2. **Reading Objects**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Author, Book

   # Retrieve all authors
   authors = Author.objects.all()

   # Retrieve a specific book by title
   book = Book.objects.get(title='Sample Book')
   ```

3. **Updating Objects**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Book

   # Update a book's title
   book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
   book.title = 'New Title'
   book.save()
   ```

4. **Deleting Objects**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Author

   # Delete an author
   author = Author.objects.get(id=1)
   author.delete()
   ```

### QuerySets and Methods

1. **Filtering**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Book

   # Filter books published after 2020
   books = Book.objects.filter(published_date__gte='2020-01-01')
   ```

2. **Ordering**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from myapp.models import Book

   # Order books by published date descending
   books = Book.objects.order_by('-published_date')
   ```

3. **Aggregation and Annotations**:

   ```python
   # views.py or interactive shell
   from django.db.models import Count
   from myapp.models import Author, Book

   # Count the number of books per author
   authors_with_counts = Author.objects.annotate(num_books=Count('book'))
   ```

### Using Django ORM in Views

1. **Views and Templates**: Query data in views and pass it to templates for rendering.

   ```python
   # views.py
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from myapp.models import Book

   def book_list(request):
       books = Book.objects.all()
       return render(request, 'myapp/book_list.html', {'books': books})
   ```

2. **Handling Forms**: Validate form data, save objects to the database, and redirect as needed.

   ```python
   # views.py
   from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
   from myapp.forms import BookForm

   def create_book(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           form = BookForm(request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               form.save()
               return redirect('book_list')
       else:
           form = BookForm()
       return render(request, 'myapp/create_book.html', {'form': form})
   ```

### Conclusion

Django’s ORM simplifies database interactions by providing a high-level API for defining models, performing queries, and managing migrations. By following these steps and exploring Django’s documentation, you can effectively work with databases and build robust web applications.
