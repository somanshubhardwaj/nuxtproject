# EXCEPTIONS

In Python, exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors and unexpected situations that may occur during the execution of your code. Here's an explanation of various elements related to exception handling:

### Try-Except Block:

The `try` statement is used to wrap the code that may raise an exception. The `except` block is used to handle the exception that occurred within the `try` block.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handling the exception
    print("Error: Division by zero")

```

### Else Block:

The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised within the `try` block. It is typically used to perform actions that should only occur if the code in the `try` block succeeds.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
else:
    print("Division successful. Result:", result)

```

### Pass Statement:

The `pass` statement is a null operation that does nothing when executed. It is used as a placeholder where Python syntax requires a statement but no action needs to be taken.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Do nothing
    pass

```

### Raise Statement:

The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception. You can raise built-in exceptions or custom exceptions.

```python
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
    elif age < 18:
        raise ValueError("You must be at least 18 years old")

try:
    validate_age(-5)
except ValueError as ve:
    print("Error:", ve)

```

### Finally Block:

The `finally` block is used to execute cleanup code that should always be run, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    # Perform file operations
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
finally:
    file.close()  # Always close the file, even if an exception occurs

```

These elements provide a robust mechanism for handling errors and ensuring that your code behaves predictably in various scenarios.
