# SETS

Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor. Sets do not allow duplicate elements, and they are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from them.

### Creating a Set:

You can create a set by enclosing comma-separated values within curly braces `{}`.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

```

### Creating a Set from a List:

You can also create a set from a list using the `set()` constructor.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_set = set(my_list)

```

### Accessing Elements:

Since sets are unordered collections, they do not support indexing. However, you can check for membership using the `in` operator.

```python
print(1 in my_set)  # Output: True

```

### Adding and Removing Elements:

You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method, and remove elements using the `remove()` or `discard()` method.

```python
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

```

### Set Operations:

Sets support various mathematical operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Union
print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3}

# Difference
print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference
print(set1 ^ set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}

```

Sets are useful for various tasks such as removing duplicates from a list, performing mathematical operations, and checking for membership or uniqueness of elements.

Sure, here are some commonly used set methods in Python:

### 1. `add(element)`:

Adds a single element to the set. If the element is already present, it does nothing.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

```

### 2. `update(iterable)`:

Adds multiple elements to the set from an iterable (such as another set, list, or tuple).

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.update([4, 5, 6])
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

```

### 3. `remove(element)`:

Removes a specified element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the element is not present.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.remove(2)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}

```

### 4. `discard(element)`:

Removes a specified element from the set if it is present. Does nothing if the element is not present.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}

```

### 5. `pop()`:

Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the set is empty.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
popped_element = my_set.pop()
print(popped_element)  # Output: 1
print(my_set)  # Output: {2, 3}

```

### 6. `clear()`:

Removes all elements from the set, leaving it empty.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)  # Output: set()

```

These are some of the commonly used methods for working with sets in Python. Sets offer efficient methods for adding, removing, and performing set operations, making them useful in various programming scenarios.
