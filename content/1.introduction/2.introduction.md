# Introduction

In Python, variables are used to store data values. You can think of a variable as a container that holds some information. Here's how you declare and use variables in Python:

```python
# Assigning values to variables
x = 10
y = "Hello, World!"
z = 3.14

# You can also assign multiple variables in a single line
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30

# Variable naming rules
# Variable names are case-sensitive and must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
# Variable names cannot start with a digit.
# Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.

# Examples of valid variable names:
my_variable = 42
myVar = "Python"
_my_variable = 3.14

# Examples of invalid variable names:
# 2variable = "Invalid"  # Starts with a digit
# my-variable = "Invalid"  # Contains a hyphen

# Printing variable values
print(x)  # Output: 10
print(y)  # Output: Hello, World!
print(z)  # Output: 3.14
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 10 20 30

```

In Python, variables don't have fixed types. The type of a variable is dynamically determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This means you can reassign a variable to a value of a different type:

```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10

x = "Hello"
print(x)  # Output: Hello

```

In the example above, `x` was initially an integer but then reassigned to a string. Python doesn't require you to declare the type of a variable explicitly.

In Python, you can work with both integer and string values. Here's how you can define and work with them:

### Integer Values:

```python
# Define an integer variable
x = 10

# Perform arithmetic operations
y = x + 5
z = x * 2

# Print the results
print("Original value of x:", x)  # Output: 10
print("Value of y:", y)  # Output: 15
print("Value of z:", z)  # Output: 20

```

### String Values:

```python
# Define a string variable
message = "Hello, World!"

# Access individual characters
first_char = message[0]
last_char = message[-1]

# Concatenate strings
greeting = "Hello"
audience = "World"
full_greeting = greeting + ", " + audience + "!"

# Print the results
print("Original message:", message)  # Output: Hello, World!
print("First character:", first_char)  # Output: H
print("Last character:", last_char)  # Output: !
print("Full greeting:", full_greeting)  # Output: Hello, World!

```

In Python, you can perform various operations on both integer and string values. However, it's important to note that certain operations are specific to each data type. For example, arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication make sense for integers but not for strings, whereas string-specific operations like concatenation (`+`) are not applicable to integers.

## IDENTIFIERS

In Python, identifiers are names given to entities such as variables, functions, classes, etc. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these entities within the code. Here are the rules for defining identifiers in Python:

1. **Character Set**:
    - Identifiers can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (`_`).
    - They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
2. **Case Sensitivity**:
    - Python is case-sensitive. This means that `my_variable`, `My_Variable`, and `MY_VARIABLE` are all considered different identifiers.
3. **Reserved Words**:
    - You cannot use reserved words (also known as keywords) as identifiers. Keywords are words that are reserved by Python for special purposes and cannot be used for naming variables, functions, etc.
4. **Length**:
    - There is no limit on the length of an identifier in Python.
5. **Convention**:
    - It's common practice in Python to use descriptive names for identifiers to make the code more readable. For example, `total_score` is a more descriptive name than `ts`.

Here are some examples of valid and invalid identifiers:

### Valid Identifiers:

```python
my_variable = 42
My_Variable = "Python"
MY_VARIABLE = 3.14
total_score = 100
_max_value = 10

```

### Invalid Identifiers:

```python
2variable = "Invalid"  # Starts with a digit
my-variable = "Invalid"  # Contains a hyphen
for = 5  # Uses a reserved keyword as identifier

```

In the examples above, `2variable` is invalid because it starts with a digit, `my-variable` is invalid because it contains a hyphen, and `for` is invalid because it's a reserved keyword in Python.

## INPUT

In Python, you can use the `input()` function to prompt the user for input. Here's a simple example:

```python
# Prompt the user for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Print a greeting using the entered name
print("Hello,", name, "! Welcome to the Python world!")

```

When you run this code, it will display "Enter your name: " in the console. The program will wait for the user to input their name and press Enter. After the user enters their name, the program will print a greeting message using the entered name.

Keep in mind that `input()` always returns a string, so if you expect numerical input, you'll need to convert it to an integer or float explicitly:

```python
# Prompt the user for their age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Print a message based on the entered age
print("You will be", age + 1, "years old next year!")

```

In this example, `int()` is used to convert the user input to an integer before performing arithmetic operations on it. If the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer, like a word, the program will raise a `ValueError`. You can also use `float()` for converting to floating-point numbers.

## EXPRESSIONS

In Python, you can perform various arithmetic operations using mathematical expressions. Here are the basic arithmetic operators available in Python:

1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.
4. **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second (always returns a float).
5. **Integer Division (//)**: Divides the first operand by the second and returns the integer part of the result.
6. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
7. **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

Here's how you can use these operators in Python expressions:

```python
# Addition
result_addition = 10 + 5  # 15

# Subtraction
result_subtraction = 20 - 7  # 13

# Multiplication
result_multiplication = 5 * 4  # 20

# Division
result_division = 15 / 3  # 5.0

# Integer Division
result_integer_division = 16 // 3  # 5

# Modulus
result_modulus = 16 % 3  # 1

# Exponentiation
result_exponentiation = 2 ** 4  # 16

# Combine operations
combined_result = (10 + 5) * 2 - 7  # 23

# Print results
print("Addition:", result_addition)
print("Subtraction:", result_subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", result_multiplication)
print("Division:", result_division)
print("Integer Division:", result_integer_division)
print("Modulus:", result_modulus)
print("Exponentiation:", result_exponentiation)
print("Combined Operations:", combined_result)

```

Python follows the standard mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), where parentheses have the highest precedence, followed by exponentiation, multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).
