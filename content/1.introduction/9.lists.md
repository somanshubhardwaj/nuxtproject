# LISTS

Lists in Python are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, which means you can change, add, and remove elements after the list has been created. Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and even other lists. Here's how you can work with lists in Python:

### Creating a List:

You can create a list by enclosing comma-separated values within square brackets `[]`.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

### Accessing Elements:

You can access individual elements of a list using indexing. Indexing starts from 0 for the first element and goes up to `len(list) - 1` for the last element.

```python
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 5 (Negative indexing starts from the end)

```

### Slicing:

You can also extract a sublist (slice) from a list using slicing notation `[start:stop:step]`.

```python
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[:3])   # Output: [1, 2, 3] (Start is omitted, defaults to 0)
print(my_list[::2])  # Output: [1, 3, 5] (Step is 2, so every second element is selected)

```

### Modifying Elements:

You can modify individual elements of a list by assigning new values to them.

```python
my_list[0] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

### Adding and Removing Elements:

You can add elements to the end of a list using the `append()` method, and remove elements using the `remove()` or `pop()` method.

```python
my_list.append(6)
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

my_list.remove(3)
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 4, 5, 6]

popped_element = my_list.pop(1)
print("Popped element:", popped_element)  # Output: Popped element: 2
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 4, 5, 6]

```

### List Operations:

You can perform various operations on lists, such as concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), and checking membership (`in`).

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

concatenated_list = list1 + list2
print(concatenated_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

repeated_list = list1 * 3
print(repeated_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

print(2 in list1)  # Output: True

```

Lists are versatile and widely used in Python for storing and manipulating collections of data.

Lists in Python come with several built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations on them. Here's an overview of some commonly used list methods:

### 1. `append()`:

Adds an element to the end of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

### 2. `extend()`:

Appends the elements of another list to the end of the current list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.extend([4, 5, 6])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

### 3. `insert()`:

Inserts an element at a specified position.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 5)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 2, 3]

```

### 4. `remove()`:

Removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]

```

### 5. `pop()`:

Removes and returns the element at the specified index. If no index is specified, removes and returns the last element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
popped_element = my_list.pop(1)
print(popped_element)  # Output: 2
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3]

```

### 6. `index()`:

Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
index = my_list.index(2)
print(index)  # Output: 1

```

### 7. `count()`:

Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
count = my_list.count(2)
print(count)  # Output: 2

```

### 8. `sort()`:

Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 2]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

```

### 9. `reverse()`:

Reverses the order of the elements in the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)  # Output: [3, 2, 1]

```

These are just a few of the many methods available for working with lists in Python. They provide convenient ways to manipulate lists according to your requirements.
