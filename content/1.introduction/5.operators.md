# BOOLEAN EXPRESSION

Boolean expressions in Python are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and logical operations. Here are some examples of boolean expressions:

### Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return `True` if the comparison is true, and `False` otherwise.

```python
x = 10
y = 5

# Equal to
print(x == y)  # False

# Not equal to
print(x != y)  # True

# Greater than
print(x > y)   # True

# Less than
print(x < y)   # False

# Greater than or equal to
print(x >= y)  # True

# Less than or equal to
print(x <= y)  # False

```

### Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

```python
x = 10
y = 5

# Logical AND
print(x > 5 and y < 10)  # True

# Logical OR
print(x < 5 or y > 10)   # False

# Logical NOT
print(not(x > 5 and y < 10))  # False

```

### Membership Operators:

Membership operators are used to test if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Membership test
print(3 in my_list)   # True
print(6 not in my_list)  # True

```

### Identity Operators:

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

# Identity test
print(x is y)  # False

# Negated identity test
print(x is not y)  # True

```

Boolean expressions are fundamental in programming as they allow you to create conditions and make decisions based on those conditions.
