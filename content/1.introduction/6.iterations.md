# ITERATIONS

Iterations in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python provides several ways to perform iterations, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and various built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()`. Here's an overview of each:

### 1. `for` loop:

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

```python
# Iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterate over a string
for char in "hello":
    print(char)

# Iterate over a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

```

### 2. `while` loop:

The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```python
# Using a while loop to count from 0 to 4
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

```

### 3. `enumerate()` function:

The `enumerate()` function is used to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of the index of each item.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")

```

### 4. `zip()` function:

The `zip()` function is used to iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously, pairing corresponding items together.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores = [85, 90, 75]
for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(f"{name}: {score}")

```

### 5. `map()` function:

The `map()` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

### 6. `filter()` function:

The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns `True`.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]

```

These are some of the common methods for performing iterations in Python. Depending on the situation, you can choose the most appropriate method for your needs.
