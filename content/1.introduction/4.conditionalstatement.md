# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. The main conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif` (short for else if), and `else`. Here's how they work:

### 1. `if` statement:

The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

```

### 2. `if``else` statement:

The `else` statement is used in conjunction with `if` to execute a block of code when the `if` condition is false.

```python
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

```

### 3. `if``elif``else` statement:

The `elif` statement allows you to check additional conditions if the previous conditions are false.

```python
x = 10

if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 15 or 5")

```

You can also nest conditional statements within each other to create more complex logic:

```python
x = 10
y = 20

if x > 5:
    if y > 10:
        print("x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 10")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 5 but y is not greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

```

It's important to maintain proper indentation in Python because it signifies the blocks of code that belong together. The standard convention is to use four spaces for each level of indentation.
