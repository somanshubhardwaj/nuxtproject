# Getting Started

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

#### Why Python?

- Easy to read and write.
- Extensive standard library and third-party packages.
- Versatile, used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.
- Large community and excellent documentation.

### 2. Installing Python

#### Download and Install Python:

- Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system PATH during installation.

#### Verify Installation:

Open your command line interface (CLI) and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the version of Python you installed.

### 3. Basic Syntax

#### Hello, World!

Let's start with a simple program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run this code in a Python environment, such as an IDE or directly in a Python shell.

#### Comments

Comments in Python are indicated by the `#` symbol.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints Hello, World!
```

### 4. Data Types and Variables

#### Variables

Variables store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.

```python
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25        # Integer
height = 5.5    # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

#### Data Types

- **int**: Integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
- **float**: Floating point number (e.g., 1.0, 2.5)
- **str**: String (e.g., "hello")
- **bool**: Boolean (e.g., True, False)

### 5. Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division
print(x % y)  # Modulus
print(x ** y) # Exponentiation
```

#### Comparison Operators

```python
print(x == y)  # Equal to
print(x != y)  # Not equal to
print(x > y)   # Greater than
print(x < y)   # Less than
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to
```

### 6. Control Flow

#### If-Else Statements

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

#### For Loops

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

#### While Loops

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 7. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### 8. Collections

#### Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Access the first element
fruits.append("orange")  # Add an element
print(fruits)
```

#### Tuples

```python
point = (10, 20)
print(point[0])  # Access the first element
```

#### Dictionaries

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Access the value for the key "name"
person["age"] = 26     # Update the value for the key "age"
print(person)
```

#### Sets

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```

### 9. File Handling

#### Reading from a File

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

#### Writing to a File

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")
```

### 10. Modules and Packages

#### Importing a Module

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Using a function from the math module
```

#### Importing Specific Functions

```python
from math import pi, sqrt
print(pi)
print(sqrt(16))
```

### 11. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### Defining a Class

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person1.greet())
```
