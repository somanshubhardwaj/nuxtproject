# STRORING AGGREGATE DATA

Enumerating the elements of a data structure involves iterating over the elements while keeping track of their indices or positions. In Python, you can use various methods to enumerate the elements of different data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

### 1. Enumerating Lists and Tuples:

You can use the built-in `enumerate()` function to iterate over the elements of a list or tuple while also keeping track of their indices.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for index, value in enumerate(my_list):
    print(index, value)

```

Output:

```
0 a
1 b
2 c

```

### 2. Enumerating Dictionaries:

When enumerating dictionaries, you can iterate over the keys, values, or key-value pairs using the `items()` method.

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)

```

Output:

```
a 1
b 2
c 3

```

### 3. Enumerating Sets:

Sets are unordered collections, so there's no inherent index to enumerate. However, you can still enumerate the elements by converting the set to a list and then using `enumerate()`.

```python
my_set = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
for index, value in enumerate(my_set):
    print(index, value)

```

Output (order may vary):

```
0 b
1 c
2 a

```

### Custom Start Index:

You can specify the starting index for enumeration by providing a second argument to the `enumerate()` function.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for index, value in enumerate(my_list, start=1):
    print(index, value)

```

Output:

```
1 a
2 b
3 c

```

By enumerating the elements of a data structure, you can easily access both the elements themselves and their corresponding indices or positions, which can be useful in various programming scenarios.
